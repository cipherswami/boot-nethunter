# Boot Nethunter

- It is an executable that boots Kali-Chroot (_one Installed with Nethunter_) in Termux. [Rooted Andriod]

**NOTE**: This is not same as _Nethunter Rootless_.

# Motive

If you have ever used Nethunter-Rooted, then you would have definitely come across Nethunter-terminal. _Nethunter-terminal_ is one of the good interfaces but, it doesn't support that much customizability when compared to other interfaces such as Termux.

If you ever took a fancy to start the _Rooted Kali chroot_ in _termux_ but faild. Then this is the right place.

# Pre-Requisites

1. Update Termux to latest Version:
   - `$ apt update`
   - `$ apt upgrade -y`
2. Restart the Termux.
3. If prompeted for superuser access to termux at any point, grant it.
